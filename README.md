## Project Requirements from the Business

This is a very simple pizza ordering application with the following requirements:

- Users can order one or more pizzas from a menu.
- No user accounts or login required: users input their name before using the app.
- The pizza menu can change dynamically and should be loaded from an API.
- Users can add multiple pizzas to their cart before ordering.
- Ordering requires only the userâ€™s name, phone number, and address.
- GPS location should be provided if possible to make the delivery easier.
- Users can mark their order as "priority" for an additional 20% of the cart price.
- Orders are made by sending a POST request with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API.
- Payments are made on delivery, so no payment processing is necessary in the app.
- Each order will receive a unique ID, which will be displayed so users can look up their order based on the ID.
- Users can mark their order as "priority" even after the order has been placed.
